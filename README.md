**JavaScript Stack Data Structure**

This repository contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure in JavaScript. A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack. This project demonstrates the creation of a stack using JavaScript classes and methods.

**Features:**
**Stack Operations**: The implementation includes essential stack operations such as push, pop, peek, size, clear and checking for an empty stack.
**Easy-to-Understand Code**: The JavaScript code is written in a simple and easy-to-understand manner, making it accessible to beginners and those new to data structures.
